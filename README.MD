Description: Evil Hangman - an algorithm that plays hangman, but eviler!
    Seriously, though, instead of picking a word, it displays a word length
    at the beginning and uses user guesses to pick from a dictionary file as 
    late as possible.  If the player doesn't win (likely) it picks a random 
    word.
Resources: C++ reference (duh), probably I had a roomate look at it at some 
    point (Jensen Krone), but I don't remember.  This is being witten less 
    than 2 hours before you get the file.
Note: I've had like, 3 hours to work on this total.  I need to work less.
